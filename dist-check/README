dist-check README

Here are two scripts which together will run fedora-review on all packages.
It takes a long, long time but seems to work somehow.

The basic idea is that we need to
- List all packages (done from the webpages).
- Find out the srpm for each package and lump package(s) and srpm together
- Download the packages when it's time for review, in parallel with
  review work.
- Discard all downloaded packages when the review goes well.

The first script is dist-check-setup. It will create a directory for each
source package. In the directory are references to all package built from the
source. This is not big (~100 MB) and can be reused.

Second script is dist-check-run. It will download packages and run 
fedora-review on them. It wants a list of directories created by 
dist-check-setup on stdin.

You probably want to use  export REVIEW_LOGLEVEL=warning to decrease
noise.

To optimize you can skip the CheckInitDeps test (takes long time). If so
you need a manual init first:
     $yum makecache

You probably also want to disable mock:
     $ mkdir bin
     $ cat > bin/mock << EOF
#!/bin/sh
exit 1
EOF
     $ chmod 755 bin/mock
     $ export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH

If you get signing errors for the rawhide packages you will find the keys
to install in the generic-release package (also in rawhide!)

Other run instructions in dist-check-run.py.

Oneliners:

All timing info in a logfile, sorted:
