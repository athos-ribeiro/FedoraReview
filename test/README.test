fedora-review unit tests.
=========================

This directory contains the unit tests for fedora-review. They can be run
either in a cloned git repository, or as installed from the
fedora-review-test-package

When using the installed package in /usr/share/fedora-review/test it must
first be copied to an area where its writeable e. g.,
   $ cp -ar /usr/share/fedora-review/test .
   $ cd test

This way, the installed version is tested. When running direct from git repo
only the git repo variant is used, even if there is a installed version.

The tests are run using the run-tests wrapper:
   $ ./run-tests

run-tests is a bash wrapper using nosetests and virtualenv which runs also on
EPEL. A deprecated script run-tests.py only working on Fedora is still lingering
here.

The REVIEW_LOGLEVEL governs the amount of logging. It defaults to 'warning' but
could be given other values .e. g., to display lot's of data when hunting down bugs:
    $ REVIEW_LOGLEVEL=debug ./run-tests

To disable slow tests:
    $ REVIEW_FAST_TEST=1 ./run-tests

Running a single test file:
    $ ./run-tests test_misc.py

Running a single test case:
    $ ./run-tests test_misc.py:TestMisc.test_sources

Avoid the trailing coverage and pylint reports:
    $  ./run-tests test_misc.py &>/dev/null || \
          echo 'Error: (logs in ../dist/build.log)'

To display a 'git status' after each test:
    $ export REVIEW_TEST_GIT_STATUS=1
    $ ./run-tests.py
