.SH NAME
fedora-review \- Automatically review RPM packages for Fedora.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fedora-review
[options] [bugzilla options] -b <bug>
.br
.B fedora-review
[options] [--prebuilt] -n <package name>
.br
.B fedora-review
[options] -u <url>

.SH DESCRIPTION

This tool makes reviews of rpm packages for Fedora easier. It tries to automate most of the process.
Through a json API the checks can be extended in any programming language and for any programming language.
We have at the moment checks for C/C++, R, Java and Perl packages.

.SH USAGE
This program runs a number of checks for packages in Fedora.
.HP
.TP 0
fedora-review -b <bug number>
.br
fedora-review -u <url>
.br
.IP "" 4
Will download the SPEC & SRPM files from the Bugzilla report,
build them in mock, run a number of tests and generate a report.
The  report will be opened in editor along with the spec file, so
the things not automated can be reviewed manually.

Not all bugzillas support -b option. The -u option only allows for
downloads and is not as reliable as -b, but works in many cases.
See  --url usage notes below.

.HP
fedora-review -n <package name>

This alternative usage expects <package name>.spec and source rpm in current
directory. By adding the -p switch, fedora-review uses already built rpms
in current directory instead of building using mock.

.PP
You will need to have mock installed and be member of the mock group
for the build to work. Run as root:
.HP
 usermod -a -G mock [your user name] && newgrp mock

.PP
To assign bugs in bugzilla automatically you will first have to login
into bugzilla (--login). This will create a bugzilla cookie so you
don't have to login every time.
.SH MODE OPTIONS - one is required
.TP 4
.B -b, --bug <bug nr>
Run against Fedora bugzilla at bugzilla.redhat.com, using the bugzilla
bug number
.TP 4
.B -n, --name <name>
Runs the checks against the named spec and source rpm located in the
current working directory. The files are expected to hane the names
<name>.spec and <name>*.src.rpm.
.TP 4
.B -u url, --url <url>
Fetch data from given url, typically another bugzilla instance without
xmlrpc support such as rpmfusion. For more modern sites with xmlrpc
support, first try --bug <bug nr> --other-bz <url>.
.TP 4
.B  -d, -display-checks
List all available checks, usable as arguments to --exclude and
--single

of building new ones in mock
.TP 4
.B -s test, --single test
Run a single test, as listed by --list
.TP 4

Provides a more detailed output of what's going on.

.TP 4
.B -x  "test1, test2, ...", --exclude "test1, test2, ..."

.SH BUGZILLA OPTIONS
.TP 4

.B -o url,--other-bz url
URL for another bugzilla.
.TP 4
.B -i id, --user userid
The bugzilla user id.
.SH --url usage notes.
The --url option tries to retrieve the URL:s by scanning the page.
In a first attempt links ending in '.spec' and 'src.rpm' are
looked for. Such links will be found. In second round, --url
looks links prefixed with labels like srpm: and Spec URL:. Obviously
this might fail as well as work. It might even pick up wrong links.
