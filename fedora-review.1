.SH NAME
fedora-review \- Automatically review RPM packages for Fedora.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fedora-review
[other options] -b <bug number> [-p]
.br
.B fedora-review
[other options] -n <package name>

.SH DESCRIPTION

This tool makes reviews of rpm packages for Fedora easier. It tries to automate most of the process.
Through a json API the checks can be extended in any programming language and for any programming language.
We have at the moment checks for C/C++, R, Java and Perl packages.

.SH USAGE
This program runs a number of checks for packages in Fedora.
.HP
fedora-review -b <bug number>

It will download the SPEC & SRPM files from the Bugzilla report and
build them in mock and run a number of test and generate a report
there will be opened in editor along with the spec file, so the things
not automated can be reviewed manually.

.HP
fedora-review -n <package name>

This alternative usage expects <package name>.spec and source rpm in current
directory. By adding the -p switch, fedora-review uses already built rpms
in current directory instead of building using mock.

.PP
You will need to have mock installed and be member of the mock group
for the build to work. Run as root:
.HP
 usermod -a -G mock [your user name] && newgrp mock

.PP
To assign bugs in bugzilla automatically you will first have to login
into bugzilla (--login). This will create a bugzilla cookie so you
don't have to login every time.
