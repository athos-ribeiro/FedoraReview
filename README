fedora-review: Tools to help review packages for inclusion in Fedora
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This tool automates much of the dirty work when reviewing a package
for the Fedora Package Collection.

Like:
- Downloading SRPM & SPEC from Bugzilla report
- Build and install package in mock
- Download upstream source
- Check md5sums
- Run rpmlint
- Generate review template with both manual & automated checks serving
  as a starting point for the review work.

fedora-review is still under heavy development.

License
-------
fedora-review is licensed under GPLv2+, for more details check COPYING.


Dependencies
------------

Install dependencies:

    # yum install python-straight-plugin python-BeautifulSoup \
          python-bugzilla  python-requests python-kitchen \
          fedora-packager rpmdevtools mock git python-fedora

The mock requirement is not hard, it's possible to use fedora-review
without mock when always using the --prebuilt/-p option. This means
that packages must be built using other tools e. g., koji. Generally,
installing without mock is not recommended.


Download
--------
Clone the source using:

    $ git clone -b devel http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/FedoraReview.git

Alternative repository for users wishing to use github:
git://github.com/timlau/FedoraReview.git. You might consider cloning
another branch e. g., a release branch. However, 'master' branch is
probably not what you want.


Running from git
----------------

After downloading (above) use try-fedora-review:

    $ cd FedoraReview
    $ ./update-version
    $ ./try-fedora-review --help

To run from any directory, install try-fedora-review according to
instructions in that script. update-version only needs to run once.


Usage
-----

    $ nroff -man fedora-review.1 | more
    $ fedora-review --help

There's more in the wiki (above).


Extending
---------

fedora-review can be extended with small shell-scripts and full-featured
python plugins. See the wiki (above).
