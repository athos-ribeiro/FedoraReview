FedoraReview: Tools to helper review packages for inclusion in Fedora
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This tool automates much of the dirty work when reviewing a package
for the Fedora Package Collection. 

Like:
- Downloading SRPM & SPEC from Bugzilla report
- Download upstream source
- Check md5sums
- Do a total review report will both manual & automated checks, ready to
  complete and paste into the Bugzilla report.

FedoraReview is still under heavy development.

Requirements
------------

* Python
* mock
* python-bugzilla
* gedit


Download
--------
Install git and run the command below to clone the source

git clone https://github.com/timlau/FedoraReview

Usage
-----
Now switch to the FedoraReview directory and switch to the src/ directory.

./review.py -b <bugzilla report number>

It will download the SPEC & SRPM files from the Bugzilla report and
build them in mock and run a number of test and generate a report there
will be opened in gedit along with the spec file, so the stuff no automated
can be reviewed manually.

You will need to have mock installed and be member of the mock group for
the build to work.

./review.py --help

Will show you the other options of the tools.

./review.py -b <bugzilla report number> -u <bugzilla user> -p <bugzilla
password> --assign

This will assign the review to <bugzilla user> and set the review flags in
the bugzilla report.
