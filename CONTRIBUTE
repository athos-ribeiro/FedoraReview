 How to contribute
===================

Basic Rules
===========

* 4-space indentation
* No whitespace at the end of the lines
* Keep the 80 line length limit
* Run pylint too see potential issues:
    - $ export PYTHONPATH=src
    - $ pylint --rcfile=pylint.conf src/FedoraReview plugins > pylint.log
* Run pep8 to see basic formatting rules:
    - $ pep8 --config pep8.conf src/FedoraReview plugins > pep8.log
* Be sensible, ask if you are unsure


Sending patches
================

* Most new work should be done on ``devel`` branch
* Prepared patches should be generated with ``git format-patch`` and sent
  to fedorareview@lists.fedorahosted.org mailinglist

Development
===========

* Branching is following strategy outlined in
  http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model
* Non-trivial features/changes should ideally be reviewed by at least one
  other developer before merging to devel
* ``master`` branch is off-limits except for merging new releases. This
  way ``master`` represents state of latest released version
* Feature branches can be rebased and/or removed. Don't rely on them
