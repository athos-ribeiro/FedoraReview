- check ldconfig - for jni files this doesn't  work
- refactor SRPMFile, Source and related classes so that they really
  contain functions related only to them (i.e. SRPMFile.get_files_rpms)
- automate some checks that can be automated (mostly generic ones)
- Review, fix and document the configuration file use.
