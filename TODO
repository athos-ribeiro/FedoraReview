- check ldconfig - for jni files this doesn't  work
- refactor SRPMFile, Source and related classes so that they really
  contain functions related only to them (i.e. SRPMFile.get_files_rpms)
- automate some checks that can be automated (mostly generic ones)
- Review, fix and document the configuration file use.
- Doc: fix manpage/Bugs
- Remove --grab
- Remove --no-report?
- Refactor: move code to define and initiate workdir to abstract_bug
- Review output, make it silent at least with higher logging levels.
- Sanitize the srpm.build() with symbolic status, accessors. Refactor
  the FSM? Move to mock?!
- See if -p can be used with -b and -u?!
- Change FR_LOGLEVEL to REVIEW_LOGLEVEL
