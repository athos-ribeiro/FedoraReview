=  fedora-review plugin API:s =

As of 0.3, fedora-review has three plugin interfaces:

 * The native python interface used by modules in the src/checks
   directory. This is the most complete, and is required e. g., when
   defining a new group of tests for a new language. This is
   descibed in the project wiki, at
   https://fedorahosted.org/FedoraReview/wiki/NewPlugin

 * The script interface used by scripts in the scripts/ directory.
   This is a small interface designed to make it possible to write
   simple tests in plain bash. This is covered in the wiki, at
   https://fedorahosted.org/FedoraReview/wiki/ScriptsApi
